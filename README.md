# CalculatorLibrary

This is a demo repository to implement the Continuous Integration(CI) using Python.

## Continuous Integration
#### Prolific developer and author Martin Fowler defines CI as follows:  
“Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible

### Problem Definition
Imagine your team is working on a simple calculator app. Your task is to write a library of basic mathematical functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You don’t care about the actual application, because that’s what your peers will be developing, using functions from your library.
